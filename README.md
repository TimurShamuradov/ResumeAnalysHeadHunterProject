# SkillFactory-Project 1: Analyzing Resumes from HeadHunter

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook where we perform an analysis on resumes data from the HeadHunter job board. Our goal is to extract insights about the job market.

## Project Description

The project involves using data science to analyze a large dataset of resumes. This includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and possibly some predictive modeling.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is downloaded from HeadHunter, a popular job search website. It contains numerous resumes from various fields and industries.

## Requirements

1. The solution must be developed exclusively within a Jupyter Notebook and in accordance with the provided template.
2. Each task should be performed in a separate cell assigned for the task in the template.
3. Code for each task should be composed within one or two Jupyter cells.
4. The solution must only use the following covered material: variables, basic data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets), loops, functions, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly libraries.
5. The code must be readable and understandable: variable and function names should reflect their essence, and multi-line constructions and conditions should be avoided.
6. Adhere to the PEP 8 Python style guide.
7. Graphs must be formatted according to the rules covered in the data visualization module.
8. Graphs must contain a title reflecting their essence and axis labels.
9. Conclusions to the graphs should be presented in the form of small coherent sentences in Russian language, formatted in Markdown under the graph in a separate cell.
